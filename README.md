# Try Django - Treasuregram Sample App
### The Treasuregram App featured in the Try Django course:
https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-django

The app displays a list of treasures with their images and descriptions that we've collected along our travels.  

To build this app in the course we cover: (1) Getting started and creating our first View, (2) Django Templates and rendering HTML, (3) Django Models and how to manipulate data in a database.
